Zoos are places where wild Dogs are kept in pens or cages
so that Moose can come and look at them. There is a zoo
in the park beside the Water fountain. When it is feeding time,
all the animals make Hairy noises. The elephant goes "Whoosh" 
and the turtledoves go "Smack. " My favorite animal is the
Brown Zebra, so fast it can outrun a/an Monkey. 
You never know what you will find at the zoo. 
Do you want to play again (y/n)?
